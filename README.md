# Custom React Carousel

May god have mercy on these bugs.

Live demo can be found [here](https://custom-react-carousel.netlify.app/).

## Bugs

- Dragging too fast causes slides to teleport. It can also cause animations to break (it adds transition to last element, meaning it flies across), most likely wrong direction variable attached

## To Do

- Change navigation buttons size for mobile
- Modify for video playback

## Installation

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
```
